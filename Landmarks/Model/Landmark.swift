// Define a Landmark structure with a few properties matching names of some of the keys in the landmarkData.json data file.
// Adding Codable conformance makes it easier to move data between the structure and a data file. You’ll rely on the Decodable component of the Codable protocol later in this section to read data from file.

// declare conformance to the Identifiable protocol. The Landmark data already has the id property required by Identifiable protocol;
// you only need to add a property to decode it when reading the data.
struct Landmark: Hashable, Codable, Identifiable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
    var park: String
    var state: String
    var description: String
    // Add an isFavorite property to the Landmark structure.
    // The landmarkData.json file has a key with this name for each landmark. Because Landmark conforms to Codable, you can read the value associated with the key by creating a new property with the same name as the key.
    var isFavorite: Bool
    
    // Add an imageName property to read the name of the image from the data, and a computed image property that loads an image from the asset catalog.
    // You make the property private because users of the Landmarks structure care only about the image itself.
    private var  imageName: String
    var image: Image {
        Image(imageName)
    }
    
    
    //Add a coordinates property to the structure using a nested Coordinates type that reflects the storage in the JSON data structure.
    // You mark this property as private because you’ll use it only to create a public computed property in the next step.
    private var coordinates: Coordinates
    
    // Compute a locationCoordinate property that’s useful for interacting with the MapKit framework.
    var locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D{
        CLLocationCoordinate2D(
            latitude: coordinates.latitude,
            longitude: coordinates.longitude
        )
